Some people like to talk formally or in the 3rd person when writing an about me page. Nope, not gonna do it.

Before you ask: Yes I'm part French. My father was born in France, and my mother in the U.S. Yes I know some of the 
French language, but am able to only speak a very little. Yes, I'm likely an embarrassment to my French relatives 
for my lack of fluency. ![me](/img/Pierre_Padovani.jpg){: .image-left }

I've been in the software industry for many years, I'm sure you can figure out how long with a little detective work. I
have a wide variety of experience across many fields ranging from IT, security to ecommerce. 
 Heck, I even managed to get a couple of patents along the way. If you 
want details, go look me up on LinkedIn. What I'm most proud of, however, is my family. 

I've got a son who amazes me every day with his continued acquisition of engineering expertise while still in high 
school. My daughter's artistic talent is blossoming like a spring flower as she gains confiedence in herself 
everyday. Finally my wife is amazing, strong and successful in her own right.

Life is short, cherish what is important.
