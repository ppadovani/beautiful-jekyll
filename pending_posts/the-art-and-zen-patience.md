title: The Art and Zen of Patience

Over the years the pace of our society has seemed to continually accelerate. With this acceleration, I believe,
our ability to be patient has declined while our impatience has increased. There can be a certain ***zen*** quality 
and reward to focusing on being patient.

If you have made it this far, you are wondering what do gemstones have to do with patience? Have you ever 
wondered what it takes to facet a gemstone? I'm not talking about the mass market stones that get faceted
out of the factories in India or wherever. I'm talking about either professional faceters, or hobbyists that
can take a rough stone and turn it into a beautifully faceted stone.

I can tell you first hand what it takes as a hobbyist myself, as the above before and after picture is one of my 
recent cuts of a peridot. 

**Time:** 
A small stone can take a few hours, a larger one two or three times that.

**Patience:**
Faceting is somewhat like woodworking, one must grind the same facet multiple times with finer and finer grit. 

**Persistence:**
Like any skill, it takes time and persistence to become even remotely capable.

**Willingness to make mistakes:**
It is all too easy to make a mistakes faceting a stone.

So, what are the steps to creating a thing of beauty from a rough piece of rock?

#### The Design

Each stone is unique in shape and qualities, and generally the design is chosen for the stone and not the other way 
around. One can choose a design, but they will search for a stone that fits the design. The design to the right is a 
a typical cut one might see in almost any piece of jewelry. There are numerous designs that have appeared over the 
last decade or so, that there are sites dedicated to trying to keep track of them all.

So, lets assume for the moment that we have a stone that is near the shape of the standard round brilliant cut, the 
faceting instructions would look like the following.

There are 73 different facets (cuts) that have to be made, each at a different angle and/or index. The index is
a specific point around a circular index wheel. Seems easy enough so far right?

Wrong. The above instructions have an R.I. (refractive index) specific to quartz. This value is used to help 
determine the angles of facets on the design of the stone. If we want to facet a material other than quartz 
we would have to transpose the angles for the proper refractive index. This doesn't take long, and doesn't require 
much effort, just a calculator with a tangent function.
