Ok, so I've used the term grok many times in my life and in many contexts. As I started putting this
blog site together I had to ask myself:

***Do I really grok the grok?***

Whenever I've used the term it was based more around my believing that the term meant 'to understand' 
in really a pure form. For example, I may be having a discussion around the design of an 
asynchronous messaging system when someone clarifies an opaqueness. This clarify I would equate 
with my new found understanding means I now 'grok' it.

However, reading the accepted definition for grok leads me to a different understanding. To grok 
something means that you instinctively/intuitively ***know*** it. You did not derive or deduce it, 
instead it just ***is***. 

Ok, so this brings to mind these questions:

***What do I really grok?***

***Do I really grok my work?***

***What have I grokked lately?***

***What the grok!?!?***

Seriously though, the best way I can describe what it means to grok something, according to the english 
dictionary snobs, is to ask this question: **What shape is in the image below?**

In your mind you immediately thought 'square'. You didn't have to think about it. ***It just was.***

This is what it means to grok something I think.

But wait, how did we intuitively come to know this? We learned it and internalized it to the point where
almost no thinking is required. Ok then, so as long as we are able to learn 'something' to the point 
that the facts become intuitive that 'something' we can say we grok.

I totally grok this.
