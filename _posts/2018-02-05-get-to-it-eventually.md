So I heard this great 
[Ted talk on the Ted Radio Hour](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/26/490626164/what-happens-in-the-brain-of-an-extreme-procrastinator)
 on NPR about procrastination this last weekend. Not only did it make me laugh, but I realized
 that what was described was, well, me.

As I listened to the broadcast, I realized that I am a habitual procrastinator. I mean take a look 
at the timestamps of my previous three blog posts:

![blog posts timestamps](/img/blog-post-times.png)

Every single one was written late at night on the day I intended to post them: 10pm, 9pm, 9:43pm.
I knew I needed to post a new blog entry and I waited until just before I headed to bed to write
and post them. Each of those posts really only took about 30 minutes to write, so **WHY** did I 
wait until the last possible moment? I always found some excuse to not sit down
and write: book, game, surfing the web etc.

As I think back I realized that in each case, I knew the basic subject matter I was going
to write about well ahead of time. However, I was unsure what **exactly** I was going to say. My mind 
flitted from idea to idea in sort of a chaos inspired whirlpool of thoughts. It wasn't until I was
approaching my self-imposed deadline, sat down at the keyboard, and started to type that things 
solidified.

So I hypothesized: 

***What if I set the deadline of my next post to be done the day before I post it?***

Well as it so happens, it **IS** the day before, and I am writing this post. In fact it is still early in the 
afternoon as I write this. This brings forward two questions in my mind:

* Does this mean that if I pull forward my deadlines, I'll be able 
to complete work I set out to do early and completely? 

* What are my motivations for procrastinating?

I believe that the first question depends a great deal on the second. Motivations for 
procrastinating can, I believe, vary a great deal. As I sit here I am attempting to look
at my own motivations in an honest and self-critical way. Can I enumerate my procrastination 
excuses?

Lets give it a try:

* It isn't fun.
* I don't know enough.
* I don't have a solution to the problem.
* People will not appreciate it.
* ...?

Here is what I intuitively believe about myself and procrastination: I over index on my
insecurities around the task, which in turn make the task arduous and not fun. I started this
blog not because it was going to be something I enjoyed, but because I wanted to push
myself and tear down some of my insecurity boundaries. 

And you know what? It has worked.
