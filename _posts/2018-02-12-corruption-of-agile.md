title: The Corruption of Agile

In a [previous post I talked about the new addiction](./2018-02-06-new-addiction) but what happens when adoption of
something leads to a corruption in the benefits of it? Everyone these days is using Agile in some way shape or form,
but as I've observed many have unknowingly corrupted the methodologies.

I'm not going to get into all of the details around agile methodologies, instead I want to focus on one aspect that
seems to get missed more often than not. Discipline. 

The funny thing is that when you talk to most people about what agile allows, they may tell you something like:

**The ability to change plans quickly.**

**I can abort a task and quickly switch to another more important task**

**The end product will more closely match customer expectations.**

All of the above is true, however if one does not exert some significant level of discipline around managing the process
you may not actually achieve any of those benefits. I would put forward that the waterfall method actually requires
***less*** discipline than agile. 

For example in the waterfall method, all planning and design for the entire product is done upfront. This means that all of the
tasks are pre-planned with all interdependencies mapped out. Agile, on the other hand, planning is done in general terms for 
the product, and each sprint includes design and implementation of small tasks. As the product begins to evolve from sprint to
sprint, changes can be made to task ordering, designs etc. **based on the results of the previous sprint.** Think about what changes
are happening to the planning around future sprints/tasks/stories etc. If you don't have discipline around manging the team, 
process and goals how do you know when you will be done, or even the direction the teams needs to go in?

Look, I develop code for a living, and even I **HATE** dealing with the details around managing projects. I would rather just
GSD (get stuff done), but even I can recognize that agile doesn't work without:

* Clear sprint goals
* Strict control around task assignments and ordering
* Control and clarity over the backlog
* Focus on goals, avoid SOS (shiney object syndrome)
* Laser like focus on blockers and struggling teams members

You can be as agile as you want, as long as you use enough discipline.
