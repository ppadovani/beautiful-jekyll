Have you ever been in the position of having to assert a position or thought, except you couldn't quite rationalize it?
Or maybe you woke up in the middle of the night with the sudden solution to a problem that had been plaguing you for
a period of time without the exact knowledge about **WHY** it was the solution. 

Each and every one of us has the capacity to solve problems in ways that I don't think can still be fully explained. These problem 
solving abilities are part of what bring about the incredible creativity the human race has managed to cultivate. In some 
cases we can find a solution to a problem far faster than a computer system can, but we may not be able to fully 
articulate **WHY** it is the answer.![einstein](/img/Albert-Einstein.jpg){: .image-left } 

This *inner einstein* is our subconscious evaluating and **rationalizing** our experiences and memories in order to solve
problems we have consciosly deemed needed solutions. I don't know about you, but I find myself sometimes unable to channel 
my inner einstein to solve a problem consciosly. I am just unable to find a rational solution to the problem I am working through.
Then, there comes the **A-HA!** moments in my life, be it in the shower or waking up in the middle of the night. In the words of 
the music group R.E.M:

***You may ask yourself, well, how did I get here?***

I've found that once I have a solution provided to me by my subconscious, rationalizing backwards to the problem is a far
easier task to complete.

When presented with a difficult problem, don't give up. Ever. 

Sleep on it.

Take a walk.

You neve know, your inner einstein might just provide you the answer.
