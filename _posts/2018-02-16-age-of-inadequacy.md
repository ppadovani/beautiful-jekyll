title: The Age of Inadequacy
---

Have you ever been in the position where you suddenly realize that your kids have begun to surpass you in terms
of knowledge and skills? Some of you may not be in that position yet, but let me tell you it can make you feel
old and inadequate.

The best way I can illustrate my thoughts is to simply reflect on my kids and what they are managing to 
accomplish. I'm an engineer by heart with a primary focus on software. I've dabbled in hardware, both 
electrical and mechanical, and believe I have a reasonable understanding of basics. If you have been reading
this blog, you might remember [my discussion around the robotics team](./2018-02-02-shortcut-to-nowhere) I'm mentoring. 
My son is on one of the teams at the school, and my daughter is on the team I mentor. 

The kids in this program have created a wide variety of highly competitive robots. Take a look at a video of a recent
competition my son's team was at. (They are the bot at the back and right.)

They were able to design, CAD and build this robot with almost no adult assistance. Each of the teams at this high
school have built their own robots and solved the games problems in unquely different ways. As the season progressed, I felt less and less like I could contribute
from an engineering design perspective. At most I could offer advice around process and project management.

Bottom line: *I felt old!*

Let's be honest, most high schoolers will look at their parents as old and behind the times. I certainly thought so when I was their age. 
As I move on in age, and my kids continue to grow in their own unique ways, I'm sure I'll continue to feel more and
more incapable of helping them intellectually. 

And you know what? I'm good with that. I may not be able to keep up with them, but I'll be there cheering them on
from the sidelines.
